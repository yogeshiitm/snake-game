## Game Rules
1. Press "Enter" to start the game.
2. Use arrow keys of your keyboard to change the direction of the snake.
3. Explore the arena without bumping into walls.
4. Collect all the food you see, and grow your snake as big as you can imagine - there are no limits!
5. Note: The snake can hit itself, i.e. you will lose only if the snake hits the wall.

## Concepts used
1. OOPs (to write structure of the game)
2. DOM manipulation (to constantly update snake's position and the scores)
3. EventListener (to take input through keyboard)
4. Caching (to store the highest score in brower's localstorage, so that even if the tab is closed the highest score of a user is not lost.)

## Future Plan
1. To extend the app for mobile users.
2. Develop a backend to keep track of highest score of each user, which will help in developing a competitive environment.
